Dear valued users,

We, S.Syed Vahtih, P.Karthi, and D.Yovel Mission Raj, from RAAK College of Engineering & Technology, Pondicherry, are proud to present our final year project - "A fully Automated AI based Trading System" web application. Our team has dedicated countless hours to develop a sophisticated and efficient program that utilizes cutting-edge AI algorithms to automatically buy stocks from your personal ID on Angelbroking application.

We would like to emphasize that while we have put in our best efforts to create an effective trading strategy, we cannot guarantee success. The stock market is inherently volatile and risky, and any investment made through our application is done at your own risk. We urge our users to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.

Additionally, we would like to clarify that our application utilizes certain features through APIs of other applications. We take no responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of the data obtained from these sources. Our program is solely responsible for executing the trades on your behalf, and any investment made through our application is subject to the terms and conditions of Angelbroking.

In conclusion, we hope that our fully Automated AI based Trading System web application proves to be a valuable tool for our users. We have developed this application with the aim of providing an efficient and automated solution to stock trading. However, we want to reiterate that any investment made through our application is done at your own risk.

Thank you for choosing our application and we wish you all the best in your trading endeavors.

Sincerely,
S.Syed Vahtih, P.Karthi, and D.Yovel Mission Raj

From,
RAAK College Of Engineering & Technology
